# nodejs-custom-templating
A Node.js-based dynamic website using custom server-side templating. Instead of a dedicated templating engine, this project utilizes manual string replacement to inject JSON data into HTML templates. The server is built with Node.js and handles routes for an overview page, product details, and an API endpoint. This project demonstrates file reading, request handling, and modular templating in a lightweight and efficient manner.
